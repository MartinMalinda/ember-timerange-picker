# Ember-timerange-picker

##WIP

ToDO

 - [ ] interval set by a param
 - [ ] get marker width on didInsertElement
 - [ ] prevent markers from colliding
 - [ ] write tests
 - [ ] implement empty area to easily drag markers to the max and min sides (current solution is UX fail)
 - [ ] render into SVG (optionally?)
